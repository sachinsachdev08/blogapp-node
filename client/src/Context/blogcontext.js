Basically, nasal breathing slows your rate of breathing down, which means your body doesn’t have to work as hard to get oxygen into your bloodstream. This is great for overall health and athletic performance, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Kinesiology and Sports Science.",

It all comes down to semantics and some murky (and consumer-hostile) guidelines set by the HDMI Licensing Administrator.In this case, Xiaomi was compliant in the eyes of the HDMI gods for burying this small endnote within the terms and conditions: “Due to the subdivision of HDMI certification standards, HDMI 2.1 is divided into TMDS (the bandwidth is equivalent to the original HDMI 2.0 and FRL protocols). The HDMI 2.1 interface of this product supports the TMDS protocol, the maximum supported resolution is 1920×1080, and the maximum refresh rate is 240Hz.”",

I haven’t seen then Galaxy Tab A8 in person yet, and some important details remain unanswered, but the specs and features suggest the new Tab A8 could be a low-cost option with few compromises.Samsung hasn’t shared official pricing yet, but based on the Tab A7's price of $229 and the Galaxy Tab S7 FE’s $530 price tag, I would venture to guess the Tab A8 will be around $250. Pricing details should be announced soon, considering the Tab A8 will be available in the US in January 2022. The Tab A8 comes in something called Pink Gold, a softer hue of Rose Gold. Blush Gold, perhaps. The other options, gray and silver, are tame.",
